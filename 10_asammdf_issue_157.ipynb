    "\n",
    "> I would like to dbc-convert the raw data, but my understanding of using extract_can_logging(dbc) on the overall MDF is that it will \"collapse\" the original data group separation into a single data group to reflect that the two physical CAN channels are recording the same CAN ID. I would need this separated as the data would in practice not be identical.\n",

    "> To do so, I assumed I would be able to split the original MDF into two MDFs, one for each data group - and then afterwards apply extract_can_logging. However, that seems to provide an empty MDF with no matches. I also notice that the structure of the resulting mdf1 and mdf2 files are slightly different vs. their counterpart data groups in the concatenated MDF.\n",
